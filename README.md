# Hotel-Booking
Recently there has been a spike in high cancellation rates, resulting in a loss in revenue. The goal of this project is to analyze the data to reduce hotel reservation cancellations and increase revenue.

# Overview
* This project focuses on Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Engineered features to convert Categorical values to Numerical Values.
* Removed Outliers and Null values to analyze the data.

# Research Questions
1. What variables affect reservation cancellations?
2. How to effectively reduce the cancellation rate?
   
# Hypothesis
1. Hotel reservation cancellation is directly proportional to the price. As the price increases, reservation cancellation increases.
2. Most reservation cancellation comes from third-party booking.

# Suggestions
1. According to the analysis, reservation cancellation increases as the price increases thus proving the hypothesis. Introducing point base system to offer a discount to loyal customers. Partnering with credit card companies to offer special prices for their customers.
2. Based on the chart, Resort hotels have higher cancellation rates compared to city hotels. Creating personalized holiday packages for families and tourists will help to increase the reservation.
