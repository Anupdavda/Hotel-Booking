# Hotel-Booking
Recently there has been a spike in high cancellation rates, resulting in a loss in revenue. The goal of this project is to analyze the data to reduce hotel reservation cancellations and increase revenue.

# Overview
* This project focuses on Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Engineered features to convert Categorical values to Numerical Values.
* Removed Outliers and Null values to analyze the data.

# Research Questions
1. What variables affect reservation cancellations?
2. How to effectively reduce the cancellation rate?
   
# Hypothesis
1. Hotel reservation cancellation is directly proportional to the price. As the price increases, reservation cancellation increases.
2. Most reservation cancellation comes from third-party booking.
